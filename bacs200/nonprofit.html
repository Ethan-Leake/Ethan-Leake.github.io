        "COVID-19 came out of nowhere. It has become an international pandemic and because of that we have had to wear masks, socially distance, and are being told to use hand sanitizer and wash our hands more frequently."

      <p class="text-right">
        "Economically we have struggled since the pandemic began because so many people have lost their jobs and businesses due to COVID-19. We were told to quarentine and have not been able to leave our homes much since the start of this pandemic."

      <h2 class="display-4 text-left text-secondary bg-link p-4">Political Implications</h2>
      <p class="text-left">
        "People are upset with the way our government has handled this pandemic because of how serious this pandemic is and how the government has taken action so far. Although it has not been handled the best way, people in government are trying their best to get a cure out to the public so that we can get our lives back to normal."
